#codebase
which files can benefit from a similar split to settings.js?

#codebase
expand the e2e tests to cover all game-end scenarios:
1. time limit (implemented)
2. score goes below zero
3. unicorn is shot
4. score limit

#codebase
expand the tests to cover at least 80% of the code

#codebase
the css and the html are too big, can we break it down?
maybe we can just divide the code into files and include the pieces into a bigger file

#codebase
the app.js is still too big, how can we break it down or what modules can we extract from it? maybe a utilities file to serve the app.js (app-utilities.js)

#codebase
if we extracted the game state as a separate class, would the code be simpler?

Candidates for Refactoring
app.js

This is often the main entry point and can become a "god file." Your prompt already suggests breaking it down (e.g., extracting utilities).
Consider splitting into modules for initialization, game loop, event handling, and utility functions.
index.html and style.css

Both are mentioned as "too big" in your prompt. You can modularize HTML (using partials and includes) and CSS (splitting by feature or component).
render.js

Rendering logic can be split into smaller modules (e.g., background, sprites, UI overlays).
src/ui/caption.js, overlay.js, scoreboard.js, scores.js

UI logic can be modularized further if these files are large, e.g., separate files for different UI components.
src/services/audio.js, stats.js, storage.js

If these service files are handling multiple responsibilities, consider splitting by feature (e.g., audio playback vs. audio settings).
config.js

If configuration is complex, split into config files per feature (e.g., game config, UI config).
